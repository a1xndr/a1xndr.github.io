<h1>Can we PWM VGA to achieve higher color depth?</h1>

<h2 id="synopsis">synopsis</h2>
<p>Probably Not</p>
<h2 id="intro">intro</h2>
<p>One of the first projects in many
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a> guides
involves displaying an image on a screen. This was also one of the first things
I tried when I got my hands on a Basys 2 board.
There are some interesting design decisions that went into the VGA specification
that clearly indicate that it was designed for analog hardware. After drawing
a few red, green and blue rectangles on the screen, I began mixing these colors.
Unfortunately,this was cut short after getting 8 colors onto the screen. The
reason for this: my vhdl module only had binary control over the red, green and
blue channels on the VGA output. This doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a problem for real graphics
adapters: plenty of video cards output True Color(24-bit) for a total of 16 777 216 colors.
Well, as I mentioned earlier, VGA was designed as an analog interface. The
concept of a digital pixel already existed, but shading the pixel was
accomplished by applying a range of voltages over the red, green and blue
channels. On various VGA-capable devices, this is accomplished by placing some
sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital-to-analog_converter">DAC</a> between
the digital outputs of the microcontroller and analog inputs on the VGA
port/cable.</p>
<p>FPGAs are intrinsically digital devices. Moreover, I had been using the onboard
VGA connector on the Digilent Basys which had no onboard DACs. I could modify
the code and add an external circuit for the DACs, resistors and VGA connector.
This seemed like an awful amount of work to display a slightly less-abrasive
shade of blue.
Then I remembered that with PWM, it is possible to output digital signals, that
when averaged over some time, appear analog. I wanted to see if I can use this
to increase the color depth of the VGA output from my FPGA without any extra
circuitry.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">implementation</h2>
<p>Nothing fancy here.
I worked off the code for my 3-bit 8colors demo.
This original hardware description was designed for a 25mhz clock(very close to the 25.175mhz pixel-clock mandated in the 640x4a80 VGA spec).
Of-course to pwm the pixels, I needed a higher-clock rate on my FPGA to enable multiple voltage changes on the RGB channels per pixel.
Luckily, I had the ability to switch clock rate on my board to 50mhz or 100mhz.
A 50mhz clock would enable me to update pixels 2 times per refresh and 4 times if I use the 100mhz clock.
So I switched the jumper to connect the Spartan-3E to the 100mhz clock.</p>
<p>The code required only minor changes.
Instead of switching the active pixel once per clock, I recalculate and increment the pixel coordinate counter only once per 4 clocks.
Also there is a secondary &ldquo;per-pixel&rdquo; counter ranging from 0 to 3. This counter
is reset for every new pixel and defines which of the 4 color bits per channel
should currently be output. Instead of doing a fancy conversion from an integer
brightness level to a sequence of binary outputs, I defined
a <code>brightness_selector: std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := '11110000'</code> and
depending on the desired <code>brightness(range 0 to 3)</code>, the per-clock pixel
brightness would be selected as <code>red &lt;-  brightness_selector(br+c)</code> where br is
the red brightness(0 to 3 range) and c is the per-pixel counter(0 to 3 range).
Thus, for a desired red brightness of 2(out of 4), on the first two clocks there
will be a 0 output on the red channel. Then for the last two clocks, the output
will be 1. Ideally, it will seem that the pixel is half-lit red.</p>

When I finished the implementation, I tried driving a modern LCD panel.
Surprise: it looked like garbage. The LCD samples the input for each pixel. As
a result the LCD displays either a fully lit or fully dimmed pixel, depending on
when the sampling occurs. For thoroughness, I tried a different LCD monitor, and
the picture looked even worse. I was going to toss my code and forget about it,
when I remembered about a CRT display close-by. I hooked-up the cable and .....
12 beautiful bits of color - and no DAC in sight! We are able to pwm CRT guns to
vary brightness of individual channels!

<h2 id="concluding-thoughts">concluding thoughts</h2>
<p>The VGA spec was designed with CRT displays in mind - three electron guns
emitting against phosphor screens with varying brightness. LCD displays use
a very different technology involving alignment and re-alignment of crystals.
While the voltage across the R G and B channels can be directly transformed to
power the Cathode ray guns, translating these voltages to the digital signals
that can be used to configure LCD matrices, requires analog to digital
conversion - I am sure that if we open up an LCD display, we will find ADC
circuitry for this precise task. ADCs generally take samples - therefore, any
PWM goes out the window.</p>
<p>Though CRTs have many benefits over LCDs, their size has made their performance
on the market decrease with the rise of digital flat-panels. I expect that
PWMing the guns also does no favors to color accuracy - I predict that 50% duty
cycle does not correspond to an exact 50% brightness. I am interested in finding
out what maximum color-bit I could achieve. Right now, I am limited by the
available quartz crystal on the dev board. With a 200mhz crystal, I could
probably make a 24-bit(TrueColor) color driver with 256 brightness levels per
channel. It may even be possible to achieve 30-bit(1024 shades per channel) or
36-bit(4096 shades per channel) color.</p>
